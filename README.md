Current Issues:

.Make deleting rooms real time with SockJS

.Make sure that when removing users from chatrooms, that other chatrooms do not
see their member list change (same problem that I had with messages before)

.Make it so that the edit and remove chatroom buttons are right next to the
date and creator name so that when switching back and forth from different chatrooms
the interface does not shift up and down

.Creator should be able to add users to the chatroom

.Maybe allow for other users to be admins

.Create a page for users that is linked when clicking on user's name

.Make everything look better

.Delete all the articles bullshit from mean.io

.Get a better logo (a big S?)

.Use nodemail to email users that they have been invited to a room

.Change chatroom to lobby like hipchat

.Figure out how to store documents(maybe paths to documents)

.Have individual chatroom more divided make them definite columns that do not bleed into each other

.Private messages

.public messages
